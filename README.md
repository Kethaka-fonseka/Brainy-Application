<!-- Main Objective -->
## Main Objective

This program endeavours to provide kids with similar experiences instead of wasting time, encouraging them to devote part of that time to academic objectives and opportunities. The primary intent is to develop and implement a game-based e-learning application for kids to increase their knowledge in the simplest way possible while simultaneously engaging with the real world. "Brainy" is an application that is essential to assist children in developing their minds or enhancing their education via a particular combination of technology and real-world activities in a controlled environment. This program is divided into chapters, which comprises four specific activities: speech recognition, object detection and augmented reality.

## Main Research Question

The major societal issue is that there has been a growing social consensus that children should be kept away from technology to some extent. However, it is a crucial and detrimental move for children's wellbeing in today's fast-paced and technologically evolved world. Nowadays, children are members of a generation that grew up with computers, tablets, and internet access. Although several e-learning systems, including game-based applications, have been created to assist in the development and education of youngsters. These applications do not seem to be updated with current technical capabilities, and these solutions have remained unchanged for a decade without technological advancements.

Furthermore, since these e-games are bound to graphics alone, there is a shift away from physical activities, vital for children's brain development. However, using 2d technology, children are presently being guided through things that they would not be exposed to regularly in the real world. However, this is bounded to the characteristics offered by the application's creators. 
As a result, there is a need for a design that may help children develop their minds or supplement their education by blending technology and real-world activities.

## Individual Research Questions

##### Pose Detection

The mobile world has become an integral part of our lives, bringing about a complete shift in how people live and interact online. The ease of use, the convenience of wireless connections, and the relatively low entry cost (at least for basic smartphone models) have all contributed to increasing the number of people who own a smartphone, including a crucial group of people who previously had little or no access to the Internet: underage children.
As a result, the use of mobile phones by young children is increasing day by day.It is not wrong for young children to use mobile phones. But uncontrolled excessive phone use can cause them security and psychological problems. 
There are many types of kids learning applications available today.The child can sit in one place to play the activities in many applications, no physical involvement is required. The World Health Organization (WHO) considers obesity to be an epidemic that will result in a slew of health issues and a reduction in life expectancy. Overweight children affected an estimated 40 million children under the age of five in 2018. 
Therefore, physical activity is very important for young children. It is in preschool that the foundation of a good man is formed. If the foundation is bad, the resulting design will not be good either. Consequently, this study proposes "Brainy -pose detection sub-system" as a companion that supports kids to get rid of phone addiction and increase the desire to do physical activities.

##### Augmented Reality

>1. How to use AR technology to improve kids’ skills and make correlation between game content and the real world or physical nature of objects?
>2. How to  develop a sense of curiosity in kids by allowing them to learn with  3D characters and objects ?

Various game-based learning applications are available for concepts, including sorting things, classifying, studying nature and shapes, listening to stories, and some other subject areas that are included and considered necessary in the preschool curriculum in any country. Most of these products have been created by utilizing only 2D technology (Mostly Cartoons). There is no correlation between game content and the natural world or the physical nature of any object. To accomplish the game's objective, the child may wait patiently for something to appear, listen to something, type, hit a button, or drag - and - drop; as we mentioned earlier, this is with the older approach.

One of the best approaches to teaching preschoolers is interacting with natural objects. Furthermore, there is no way to prevent memories from fading, even if it is done without using technology. However, with augmented reality and technology, kids may relive the excitement and experience something they have never had before.

## Individual Objectives

### IT19171234-IB

The proposed Brainy application is a story-based kids learning application. This application consists of several chapters. Each of these chapters has different activities. These activities can be divided into four parts. They are,

1. Voice based activities
2. Human motion-based activities
3. Object based activities
4. AR based activities

Each of the above types of activities is managed by four subsystems. Pose detection is one of those 4 subsystems. The main objective of the pose detection sub-system is to create a controller for managing and controlling the activities that need the physical involvement of the kid. As mentioned earlier, physical activities are a vital part of a child's life.Currently, mobile phone cameras in the world do not have the technology to distinguish between physical activities. Therefore, a systematic technical approach is needed to distinguish them. That is why pose detection subsystem is very important for Brainy application. The pose detection subsystem has a mechanism that converts the poses gestures and facial expressions obtained from the camera to a numeric value with the help of an API and compares that value with the values of the previously estimated poses to determine whether the pose, guest, or body movement is correct. Therefore, the child can better interact with the activities in the game that requires physical involvement.



##### Creating an activity set

Pose detection is a subsystem comprised of several actions. These activities are classified into numerous categories. They are indeed.
1. Activities involving gestures.
2. Exercises.
3. Exhibiting things visually.
4. Activities entailed some degree of movement.

These are activities that small toddlers participate in. They are incapable of thinking or acting independently. That is why each activity includes animated instructions and demonstration videos. The Brainy application is a story-based children's game. The story of this game is structured around these activities. Thus, there is a flow to these activities, and these activities are organized in accordance with that flow.

##### Implementing an algorithm to detect poses
As previously stated, the pose detection subsystem is composed of a variety of functions.
This algorithm's primary objective is to discover Exercises and Activities that need some degree of movement and to validate their accuracy.
For instance, 

1. Jumping
2. Take a seat in a chair
3. Fly
4. Run in a straight line,

When a camera detects movement or pose, it first sends the information to the pose detection API located within the pose detection subsystem. The API translates the user's movement or pose to a numeric representation. Then, this algorithm compares the numerical value to the values of previously calculated postures and determines whether or not the pose or body movement for the particular activity is correct. Small youngsters perform this movement or stance. As a result, they may have small defects. That is why the post detection algorithm examines the value range of the movement or pose rather than the exact value.

##### Implementing an algorithm to detect gestures and hand movements

 This algorithm's primary objective is to discover Activities involving gestures and Activities that Exhibiting things visually and to validate their accuracy. For instance, 

1. Show count using hand
2. draw shapes by hand

The post detection subsystem has a separate API for pose detection as well as a separate API for gestures and and hand movement. The pose detection API as well as the gesture / hand movement detection API convert the data provided by the camera to numerical values. Then, this algorithm compares the numerical value to the values of previously calculated gesture or hand movement and determines whether or not the gesture or hand movement for the particular activity is correct. But in such activities like "Show count using hand" these values cannot be directly compared. Therefore, in counting related activities, this algorithm converts the values obtained from the API back to a normal number between 1-10 and determines its accuracy.


### IT19053592-IB

##### 1. Modelling of 3D models of the characters and objects.

 > According to the game's story mode, each chapter and task may contain a significant number of 3D objects and characters. These interactive storytelling characters will engage with pre-school player throughout the game, stimulating their curiosity in the narrative. Each storyline may include a series of activities that use these generated 3D objects, such as vegetables and fruits, as well as characters, such as gaming characters and animals. This will provide children with an opportunity to experience or explore something they have never had before.

##### 2. various assessments under game storyline that allows kids(player) to interact with created models and learn.

1.	Sorting objects activities.
2.	Identifying objects/characters activities.
3.	Puzzle activities.
4.	Mathematical activities.
5.	Scientifical activities.
6.	Storytelling.

> These activities will eventually interact with  3D objects and characters according to the game design definition.

##### 3. Integrating and training 3d models according to activities.

> All 3D models must adapt to the game's contexts. This application must complete an essential factor: training these 3D models to engage with the device's gesture system, make animation for each movement.

##### 4. Merge 3D characters with audio.

> Aforementioned, 3D characters are interacting with the player 3D characters must be embedded with audio for each task frame by frame.

##### 5. Programming gaming function of AR subsystem.

> In this sub-objective, all the 3D elements and training records must be integrated with the unity game engine, and  this is where the main AR game functions will be implemented and programmed according to game levelling system and the game scenario.
